# to-build

> A list of things to build as soon as I get some free time!

***

### 1. [write-good](https://github.com/btford/write-good) Chrome Extension

> For grammatical error free emails, and other conversation on the web.

#### Idea:

1. A chrome extension
2. Add option to the right click menu (Check for errors)
3. And show errors using easiest way to start with, then, slowly move on to in place highlighting, and other fancy stuff!

### 2. AIR news Scraper

> Scrape the page newsonair.nic.in every morning, and send an email to all subscribers

#### Idea:

1. Something that is deployed on heroku
2. Every morning around 8:45 scrape the page
3. Ensure that it is the news bulletin of that day
4. Also, include the link to the voice MP3 of that days morning news.

### 3. Github Canned Responses

> A clone of [this](https://github.com/notwaldorf/github-canned-responses)

#### Idea:

1. Add LGTM
2. Have an option for custom responses (probably there in the original as well.)
