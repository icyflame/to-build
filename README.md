### 1. [write-good](https://github.com/btford/write-good) Chrome Extension

> For grammatical error free emails, and other conversation on the web.

#### Idea:

1. A chrome extension
2. Add option to the right click menu (Check for errors)
3. And show errors using easiest way to start with, then, slowly move on to in place highlighting, and other fancy stuff!
